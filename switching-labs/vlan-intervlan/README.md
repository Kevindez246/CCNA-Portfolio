# 🧰 VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing Lab

## 🎯 Overview
This lab demonstrates how to configure **VLANs**, assign access ports, and enable **router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing**.  

It also includes **broken variants** to practice troubleshooting, along with the **fixed solutions** — showing both diagnostic and configuration skills.

## 🖥️ Topology
* 1x Cisco IOSv Router (R1)  
* 1x Cisco IOSv Switch (SW1)  
* 2x VPCS hosts (PC1 in VLAN 10, PC2 in VLAN 20)  

📸 *See lab diagrams and configs in [LAB_GUIDE.md](./LAB_GUIDE.md).*
