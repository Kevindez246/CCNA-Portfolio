# 🧰 CCNA Lab Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my **hands-on CCNA portfolio** built in GNS3 and VMware.  
It demonstrates not only configuration skills but also **troubleshooting, documentation, and network design** — the full toolkit employers expect from a junior network engineer.

## 🔹 Lab Categories

### 🔸 Switching Labs
- [VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing](./switching-labs/vlan-intervlan/)  
  Configure VLANs, router-on-a-stick, and troubleshoot common issues.  

### 🔸 Routing Labs
- Static & Dynamic Routing (OSPF focus).  
  Showcases subnetting, route advertisement, and path selection.  

### 🔸 Security Labs
- [ACLs](./security-labs/acls/) – Traffic filtering and access control.  
- [NAT/PAT](./security-labs/nat-pat/) – IP translation for WAN/Internet access.  

### 🔸 Troubleshooting Scenarios
- Intentionally broken labs to demonstrate **diagnosis + repair process**.  

### 🔸 Network Designs
- [Home Network (pfSense-based)](./network-designs/home-network/)  
  Realistic design with segmentation, DHCP/DNS, and firewall zones.

## 📖 Why This Portfolio Matters

Employers don’t just want certifications — they want proof of **real-world, hands-on capability**.  
This repo shows:

- **Configuration fluency** (raw configs + guides).  
- **Troubleshooting process** (broken/fixed labs).  
- **Documentation habits** (readable Markdown, screenshots, diagrams).  
- **Initiative**: building skills without physical routers/switches.

## ✍️ Beyond GitHub

Each lab will also be published as a **Medium article** (300–600 words) with:  
- What the challenge was  
- How I solved it  
- Screenshots & configs  
- Reflection on what I learned  

📎 *(Links will be added here as articles go live)*
